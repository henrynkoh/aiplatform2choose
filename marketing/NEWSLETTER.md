**Preheader**: Learn how to get the best recommendations

**Body**:

Hi [Name],

Ready to get your first recommendation? Here's a quick guide to help you get the most out of BuildFast Advisor.

**Step 1: Be Specific in Your Goal**

❌ Too vague: "an app"
✅ Better: "a mobile fitness app for iOS with workout tracking, progress charts, and social challenges"

**Why?** More details = better recommendations!

**Step 2: Set Realistic Budgets**

Most no-code tools cost:
- Free tier: $0
- Basic: $10-30/month
- Professional: $30-100/month
- Enterprise: $100+/month

**Step 3: Be Honest About Timeline**

Consider:
- Learning curve (2-3 days for new tools)
- Development time
- Testing (1-2 days)
- Buffer time (20% extra)

**Step 4: Review All Sections**

Don't just look at the "Best Option"—check the comparison table and important notes too!

**Step 5: Export to Google Sheets**

Use the export feature to track your project and collaborate with your team.
